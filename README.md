# netlogo-wumpus
A Netlogo implementation of the Wumpus game with heuristics solutions and a neural network.

This model is an example of heuristics and reinforcement learning to solve the "Hunt the Wumpus" game: an adventurer walks through a labyrinth, he has to find a fabulous treasure but numerous treacherous traps await him. Indeed, multiple bottomless pits and a terrible monster, the Wumpus, lie in the labyrinth.

To help himself, the adventurer only has a light torch (that does not light up a lot...), a bow with **one arrow** and his **senses** to help him. Indeed, getting close enough to a bit will make him feel a soft breeze of wind (grey squares), whereas a close encounter with the Wumpus will have disagreable relents (red squares). And if he gets really unlucky, he will get really close to both (purple squares).

This game has two modes: simulation where the adventurer learns to defeat the labyrinth by itself, and a playing mode where you can guide the adventurer to the fabulous treasure!
